# Motivation

## The Problem

State management in React applications can be challenging, especially when you need to:

1. **Share state across components** that aren't directly related in the component tree
2. **Initialize state dynamically** based on props or external data
3. **Balance global vs. local state** needs
4. **Maintain type safety** throughout your application
5. **Support multiple instances** of the same component with isolated state

The React Context API solves some of these problems but can lead to performance issues due to re-renders. Zustand provides a great solution for global state management but doesn't have built-in support for context-aware, locally scoped state.

## Why zustand-context?

zustand-context bridges this gap by combining the best of both worlds:

### üîÑ Zustand's Simplicity and Performance

- **Minimal API** - Simple hooks-based API just like Zustand
- **Selective re-renders** - Only components that use the selected state are re-rendered
- **Middleware support** - Compatible with all Zustand middleware (persist, immer, devtools, etc.)

### üåü React Context's Flexibility

- **Component-scoped state** - Create isolated state for specific component trees
- **Dynamic initialization** - Initialize state based on props or external data
- **Provider nesting** - Support for nested providers with proper state isolation
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support throughout

## When to Use zustand-context

zustand-context is particularly useful when:

- You need **multiple instances** of the same component with isolated state
- You're building a **component library** with encapsulated state management
- You want to **initialize state dynamically** based on props or server data
- You need to **scope state to a specific part** of your application
- You're looking for a **Zustand-like API** with context support

## Real-World Use Cases

zustand-context excels in scenarios like:

- **Multi-tenant applications** where each tenant needs isolated state
- **Form libraries** that need isolated state for each form instance
- **Data grids** with independent sorting, filtering, and pagination state
- **Wizard/multi-step components** with complex state transitions
- **Dashboard widgets** that need isolated yet shareable state
